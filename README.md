# MusicShit
A tweak to replace labels in the Music app with something funny !

## Features
* Enabled/Disabled

And that's it !

## Screenshots
I decided not to provide any ! Try it out to see !  
Or if you're familiar with the code, _just read it_ :) 

## Bruh it's not working
Just remove the Music app from multitasking and re-open it.  
Do this operation every time you enable/disable the tweak. 

## Credits
I learnt to make this tweak thank to [this cool tutorial](https://cwcaude.github.io/project/tutorial/2020/07/12/iOS-tweak-dev-3.html) by [@cwcaude](https://github.com/cwcaude), but I strongly recommend reading it from Part 1 !
